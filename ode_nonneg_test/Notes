Figure 1:
  Based on 1000 iterations, with a min value of 1e-5, and rates between 0.1 and 1000. Time span is between (0, 10).
  IVP tolerance is 1e-6 for both atol and rtol
  Number of equations is uniform between 2 and 20
  y0 between 0 and 50

Figure 2:
 300 iterations, histogram range bounded between 0 and 1000, rates reduced to be between 0.1 and 10

Figure 3:
 Same as figure 2, but rates for (i,i) are uniform between 0.1 and 100
